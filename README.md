# How to download and set project as your work repository?
- Clone repo and init into your Netbean project folder. 
- Change your project folder name to Web-Ecommerce.

- SQL is available. Download SQL first and create a database for the project.
- Database are kept as a seperate work-group, which means no username or password required.

| JavaDB name   | WareModel     |
| User          | `app`         |
| Password      | `app`         |

# Updating Controller and Model classes from SQL (IMPORTANT)
If there is any change made on SQL file, all model and controller classes may need to be updated. 
- Delete all entity classes from database and create it again.
- Delete all JPA controllers and recreate them all.
